I am Rodolfo Delgado, I am 22 years old and I live in Montevideo, Uruguay. Since I was little I was a lover of video games. Today I still do it and I also want to develop them. <br>
I am a Game Developer and I use Unity engine to make diferent kind of experiences or video games, like in 2D/3D and AR/VR.
